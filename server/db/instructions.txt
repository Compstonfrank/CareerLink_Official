How to set up the backend database:

- create a database with the name "careerLink"
- set a node environment variable with the name 'usernameDB'
  - it should equal the name for your postgres db
    - find this by running `psql` in the terminal, and looking at the name to the left of `=#`
  - you can do so in the terminal, like so `export usernameDB=justin`
  - this is used in config.js
  - I did this while I was in the `CareerLink_Official` scope in the terminal
- globally install the sequalize commandline interface
  - `npm i -g sequelize-cli`


!!!! IMPORTANT !!!!
- cd into `server/db` before you use Sequelize cli
- run `sequelize db:migrate` to run all of the migration files which haven't been run yet
